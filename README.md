Project Background - Customer Segmentation
E-booking startup TravelTide is a hot new player in the online travel industry. It has experienced steady growth since it was founded at the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic (2021-04) on the strength of its data aggregation and search technology, which is best in class. Customer feedback has shown - and industry analysts agree - that TravelTide customers have access to the largest travel inventory in the e-booking space. 
 
Following the startup playbook, TravelTide has maintained a hyper-focus on building an unfair advantage along a limited number of dimensions - in this case, building the biggest travel inventory and making it easily searchable. Because of this narrow focus, certain aspects of the TravelTide customer experience are underdeveloped, resulting in poor customer retention. CEO Kevin Talanick is very motivated to retain and add value to existing customers with a Marketing strategy built on a solid understanding of customer behavior.
Project Time Structure in Detail
In each of the four weeks we will get one step further in our goal to help Elena and TravelTide:
 
EDA - Exploring the Data:
Familiarize yourself with the business context and available data. Use available tools(SQL, Python, or Sheets) to understand the tables, the project, and its needs.

Feature Engineering - Devising Metrics:
Think of the business case to identify key characteristics that can be used to characterize or group customers. Come up with combined columns that really capture interesting facts about our customers that may help us to group them. Go back to the session table and think of what aggregations can be additionally included for the users.


Customer Segmentation - Grouping the Customers:
Perform customer analysis using the created metrics to find customer groups, understand them and find meaningful perks for members of each group.


Presentation:
Create an executive summary and slides of the customer analysis results. Describe the grading scheme and the customer groups/clusters. Explain the characteristics of the customers within each group/cluster, such as their behavior, preferences, and other defining attributes. Give examples of group members as personas or directly from the dataset.
